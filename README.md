<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

A quick demo: _stream my screen using OBS_

![Demo](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ecg4fjwub344ure/demo.gif?dl=1)

Why do I create this project:

- To practice my React and Redux skills.
- To explore and dive into OAuth 2.0 and Google APIs.
- Learn how a RTMP server works.
- Kill my free time ðŸ˜….

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) (of course ðŸ™ƒ)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [Redux-form](https://redux-form.com/8.2.2/)
- [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), [node-media-server](https://github.com/illuspas/Node-Media-Server)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Since this is just a fun project, I decide not to deploy this app online. So you can follow these steps to run it locally!

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node, npm and React in your machine. But you also need [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) to push a stream to the website!

### Project structure:

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ stream
    â”œâ”€â”€ client
    â”œâ”€â”€ stream_apis
    â”œâ”€â”€ streams_rtmpserver
```

### Installation

1. Create project directory in your machine:

```sh
mkdir streams
cd streams/
```

3. Clone the repositories:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/phuongminh2303/twitch_stream_clone.git
git clone https://github.com/phuongminh2303/stream_api.git
git clone https://github.com/phuongminh2303/streams_rtmpserver.git
```

4. Install NPM packages in **each folder** of the project:

```sh
npm install
```

5. Run all the **client server**, **api server** and **rtmp server** at the same time:
   ![Start server](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/9l5k7a7f3k5t33u/start_server.gif?dl=0)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

You can follow these steps to deploy a new stream to the app:

1. Sign in using your google account (It's totally **safe** ðŸ˜‰).
2. Create a new stream using the "Create a stream" button.
3. Click on the stream you've just created. You will see something like this:
   ![Show stream](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0qyg1q3eo4i1e3x/test_stream.png?dl=1)
4. Now open OBS and create a new stream:

- Create new scene in "Scenes" section.
- In the "Sources" section, add "Screen Capture (XSHM)" and "Audio Input Capture".
- Next, open Settings/Stream, then choose "Custom..." in Service section.
- Add this line to the Server section: `rtmp://localhost/live`
- Put your stream id into the "Stream Key" section, **stream id** can be found in your stream url:
  -- In this example, my stream url is: _localhost:3000/streams/5_. So my **stream id** is 5!
- Click Ok then start your stream. Go back to the website and enjoy!!! ðŸ˜™
- Sometime you need to refresh the page after starting a new stream.
